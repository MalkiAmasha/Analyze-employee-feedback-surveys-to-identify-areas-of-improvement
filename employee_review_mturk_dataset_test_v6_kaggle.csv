20099,Blake Booth,"Category 1: 'Risk' (Low performance, Low potential)","For the past quarter, Blake has had tremendous opportunities to showcase his abilities and prove his worth to the management, but sadly, he has let the opportunity go begging. He failed in the most basic customer satisfaction surveys which shows that his customers are not at all happy with the service he is providing.

Being an athlete himself with a few years of product design and graphic design experience, he has the knowledge to take product designs through from beginning to end. He's exemplified this through his ideas and reasoning in multiple meetings. But, I have noticed he has struggle to get things started on some of these interesting, ingenious designs he's voice.
